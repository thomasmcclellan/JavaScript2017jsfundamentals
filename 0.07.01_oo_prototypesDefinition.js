//Every single 'object' is built by a constructor function
//There are only two languages that deserve the monicer 'object oriented': JS and Liluah

//Each time a constructor is called, a new object is created

//A constructor makes an object 'based on' its own prototype => 'based on' implies false info about JS
//It implies that we take a prototype and stamp a copy out of it and once the two have been separated, there is no relation between the two

//More accurately: 
//a constructor makes an object 'linked to' its own prototype
